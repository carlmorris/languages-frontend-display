This Plugin is an extension for qTranslate-X (and will not work alone).

You can exclude some languages on frontend. Check the plugins settings page.

The excluded languages will not appear in language chooser.
In case someone wants to access an excluded language, he/she/it/they will be redirected to the default language. 


qTranslate-X option "Detect Browser Language" and  "URL Modification Mode -> Hide URL language information for default language" has to be false.


Thanks to CMB2 for their easy metaboxes and optionpages!
